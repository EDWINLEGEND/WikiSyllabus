## BEng (Computer Engineering) Curriculum ‚öôÔ∏è

### Program Philosophy

The Computer Engineering (CEG) program is built on the idea that computer engineers need a balanced education in **electrical engineering, software design, and hardware/software integration**. The curriculum is designed to provide a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, circuits, programming, software engineering, computer architecture, networks, and embedded systems.

The program's focus is on training you to apply computer technology as an **enabler** to solve real-world problems. After building a strong technical core, you can use **technical electives** to specialize in areas that interest you, gaining in-depth knowledge to prepare you for a variety of industries.

### Degree Requirements (for AY2025/26 Intake)

To graduate, you must complete a minimum of **160 units** with a GPA of 2.0 or higher. The curriculum is broken down into three main components.

| Component | Description | Units |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Programme Requirements** | This is the technical core of the degree, providing fundamental knowledge in electrical and computer engineering, followed by specialized technical electives. | **96** |
| **General Education (GE)** | These courses are meant to broaden your perspective. You must complete one course from each of the six pillars: <br> ‚Ä¢ Communities and Engagement <br> ‚Ä¢ Cultures and Connections <br> ‚Ä¢ Critique and Expression <br> ‚Ä¢ Digital Literacy <br> ‚Ä¢ Data Literacy <br> ‚Ä¢ Singapore Studies | **24** |
| **Unrestricted Electives** | These units can be used to take courses from any faculty across NUS, allowing you to explore other interests or deepen your primary field of study. | **40** |
| **Total** | | **160** |

### Important Notes üìù

  * **Level-1000 Limit:** There is a **60-unit limit** for Level-1000 courses that can be counted towards your degree.
  * **Physics Bridging:** Students admitted without H1/H2 Physics (or equivalent) are required to take a bridging course (`PC1222`/`PC1201`).
  * **Polytechnic Graduates:** For students admitted from polytechnics, the 20 units of advanced placement credits awarded for polytechnic work will **not** count against the 60-unit limit on Level-1000 courses.
