# PhD-CS: PhD in Computer Science

## Course Objectives
* To provide a premier, research-based program for graduates with strong academic potential, leading to a doctoral degree.
* To build a strong foundation through advanced coursework during the first two semesters before students embark on research.
* To guide students in conducting a significant, in-depth research project that culminates in a dissertation.
* To formally assess a student's research aptitude and potential through a mandatory Qualifying Examination (QE).
* To develop students' ability to propose, conduct, and defend novel research in a specialized area of computer science.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Master advanced concepts in computer science by successfully completing 24 units of rigorous coursework across multiple research clusters. *(Cognitive level: Understand)*
* **CO 2:** Demonstrate critical research and problem-solving abilities by passing a Qualifying Examination based on a research paper review and presentation. *(Cognitive level: Evaluate)*
* **CO 3:** Formulate and defend a novel research proposal, effectively outlining its significance, goals, and methodology to a panel of experts. *(Cognitive level: Create)*
* **CO 4:** Conduct original, independent research in a specialized area of computer science, culminating in a significant contribution to the field. *(Cognitive level: Create)*
* **CO 5:** Synthesize original research findings into a comprehensive written dissertation and successfully defend it in a final oral examination. *(Cognitive level: Synthesize)*

## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Year 1: Coursework and Research Exploration)
* **Structure:** Students spend the first two semesters on advanced coursework to build a strong theoretical foundation.
    * **Semester 1:** 8 units coursework + CS6101 (Exploration of CS Research).
    * **Semester 2:** 8 units coursework + Initial Research.
* **Coursework Requirements:** Candidates must complete 24 units, with at least 16 units from the CS department. Coursework must cover at least three of the five research clusters: Algorithm and Theory, Computer Systems, Knowledge Systems, Media Technologies, and Programming Language/Software Engineering.

### Module - 2 (Year 2: Qualification and Research Focus)
* **Structure:** Students complete their coursework and must pass the Qualifying Examination to proceed as a PhD candidate.
    * **Semester 1:** 8 units coursework + Qualifying Examination (QE).
    * **Semester 2:** Full-time Research.
* **PhD Qualifying Examination (QE):** Taken within 18 months of admission. It involves a critical review of research papers and a presentation to a faculty panel. Passing the QE is mandatory to continue in the PhD program; otherwise, the student transitions to an MSc candidature.

### Module - 3 (Year 3: Thesis Proposal and Advanced Research)
* **Structure:** The focus shifts entirely to research, with the key milestone being the thesis proposal.
    * **Semester 1:** Research + Thesis Proposal / Doctoral Seminar.
    * **Semester 2:** Full-time Research.
* **PhD Thesis Proposal:** The proposal must highlight the research topic's significance, goals, and approach. It is presented in a public doctoral seminar, followed by a closed-door oral examination with two faculty members.

### Module - 4 (Years 4-5: Final Research and Defense)
* **Structure:** The candidate finalizes their research, writes the thesis, and defends their work. The maximum candidature is 5 years.
    * **Semesters 1 & 2:** Full-time Research, Thesis Submission, and PhD Defense.
* **PhD Defense:** This is the final step, consisting of a 30-40 minute public seminar on the research, followed by a closed-door oral examination with a 3-member panel.
